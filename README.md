# Dianthus
Welcome to Dianthus, a sophisticated React web application with a Supabase as the backend meticulously crafted to streamline cabin management and booking processes. Our app leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. Here's a glimpse of what makes this repository exceptional:

🚀 **Cutting-Edge Technologies**: We harness the power of React, React Router, React Query, and React Hot Toast to create a feature-rich, highly responsive application.

🌐 **Routing Perfection**: With the help of `react-router-dom`, we've designed a dynamic routing system that effortlessly guides users through various sections of the application.

💡 **Smart Data Management**: The application is supercharged with `@tanstack/react-query`, enabling intelligent data fetching and management. Say goodbye to slow loading times!

🔍 **Debugging Made Easy**: Stay in control with the integrated `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, making it a breeze to monitor and debug React Query data and queries.

📢 **User-Friendly Notifications**: We've implemented the stylish `react-hot-toast` library for informative and visually appealing notifications, ensuring a smooth user experience.

🎨 **Consistent Design**: Enjoy a sleek and consistent design across the entire app, thanks to the included `GlobalStyles`.

🌙 **Dark Mode Support**: Choose between light and dark modes with our `DarkModeProvider` context, enhancing user comfort during extended usage.

🔒 **Protected Routes**: Keep your data secure with protected routes via `ProtectedRoute`. Only authorized users can access certain sections, ensuring privacy and integrity.

📄 **Comprehensive Pages**: Explore various pages, including Dashboard, Bookings, Cabins, Users, Settings, Account, Login, Booking, and Checkin. Each page is meticulously designed for maximum utility.

🚧 **Handle 404 Gracefully**: Our custom 404 page (PageNotFound) gracefully handles navigation to non-existent routes, preventing frustration.

🍞 **Toaster Notifications**: The `react-hot-toast` library provides toast notifications at the top-center of the screen, offering timely feedback and communication.

⚙️ **Query Client Customization**: We've fine-tuned the Query Client with custom default options, allowing you to control query behavior, including a short `staleTime` for real-time data freshness.
